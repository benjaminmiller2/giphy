Ok, I apologize for this...I've just started re-watching Parks and Rec on Netflix, and I've got this on the brain.

Simply select the button of your favorite character at the top, and 16 still-frame gifs will display on the page. Click on the still to activate the gif's animation. Click on it again to deactivate it.

If you don't see your favorite Parks and Rec character among the buttons at the top of the page, or if you want to explore the bounty of gifs that the Giphy API has to offer, simply use the search box on the right-hand side to a new button of your choice to the button bar.
